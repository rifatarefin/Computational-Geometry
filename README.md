#### Time Complexity of Graham Scan Algorithm:
Time complexity of Graham Scan algorithm is always *`O(nlogn)`* irrespective of the input. *`O(nlogn)`* time is needed while sorting the vertices according to their angle with the most bottom-right vertex.

#### Case 1: *Graham Scan* performs better than *Gift Wrapping*:
